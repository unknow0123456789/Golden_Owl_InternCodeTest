# Golden_Owl_InternCodeTest
A Flutter application as the task of the internship Test


# Completed Goals
  - Fully completed UI for `Our Products` and `Your Cart` followed the UI from [live demo][LDlink].
  - All Required Functions are working.
  - Products in the cart are `persistent`, users will see exactly what they have put in their cart the next time they visit it.
# Uncompleted Goals
  - Do not have `animations`.
  - Did not `deploy` to any hosting platform.
# Application instruction
  - The Application includes `2 pages` in the same `screen`.
  - The first page is `Our Product`, which will display all the products for the users to choose and buy. On this page, users can scroll through many products and add them to their cart. Once a product have been add to the cart, the `add to cart` button will change to a `check` button and will be disable.
  - The second page is `Your Cart` which displays all the products that the user has chosen and the quantities of them. Here the users can change the quantities of those products by the `minus` and `bonus` buttons, they will also be able to completely erase a product from their cart with the `bin` button. Once a product has been erased from the cart, its `add to cart` button will become available again.
  - The application comes with `Share_reference` plugin from `Flutter` which enables it to save products in users' carts locally, allowing the data to be `persistent`.
